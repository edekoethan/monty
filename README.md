Stacks and queues are two fundamental data structures used in computer science to store and retrieve elements.

A stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It resembles a stack of items, where the last item added is the first one to be removed. Elements can be added or removed only from one end, commonly referred to as the "top" of the stack. This behavior is analogous to a stack of plates, where you can only take the top plate or add a new plate on top. The operations on a stack include push (adding an element to the top) and pop (removing an element from the top).

A queue, on the other hand, is an abstract data type that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It resembles a line of people waiting for a service, where the first person to join the line is the first to be served. Elements are added at one end (the "rear" or "back" of the queue) and removed from the other end (the "front" or "head" of the queue). The operations on a queue include enqueue (adding an element to the rear) and dequeue (removing an element from the front).

Both stacks and queues have various real-world applications. For example, a stack can be used for function calls in programming, undo/redo operations, or evaluating expressions. A queue is often used for scheduling tasks, handling requests in network communication, or implementing a printer spooler


Thank you for providing more information. Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that utilizes a unique stack and is compiled into Monty byte codes, similar to Python. The objective of the project surrounding Monty 0.98 is to develop an interpreter specifically designed to handle Monty ByteCodes files.

The interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files would involve executing the Monty byte codes and performing stack manipulation operations as defined by the language. The Monty byte codes would contain instructions specific to the manipulation of the stack, allowing users to add elements, remove elements, and perform other stack-related operations.

By creating an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files, users can write Monty scripts and execute them using the interpreter. The interpreter would read the Monty byte codes, understand the instructions, and execute them accordingly on the stack, thereby achieving the desired behavior as defined by the Monty language.

The Monty 0.98 project focuses on providing a toolset to work with Monty ByteCodes files efficiently and to enable users to leverage the unique stack and instructions offered by the language.

Tasks
0. push, pall
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the push and pall opcodes.

1. pint
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the pint opcode.

The pint opcode

The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pint
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

2. pop
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the pop opcode.

The pop opcode

The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

3. swap
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the swap opcode.

The swap opcode

The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: swap
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't swap, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

4. add
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the add opcode.

The add opcode

The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: add
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't add, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter

5. nop
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the nop opcode.

The nop opcode

The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.

Usage: nop

6. sub
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the sub opcode.


7. div
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the div opcode.

8. mul
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the mul opcode.

The mul opcode

9. mod
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the mod opcode.

10. comments
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).

11. pchar
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the pchar opcode.

12. pstr
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the pstr opcode.

13. rotl
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the rotl opcode.

The rotl opcode

The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.

14. rotr
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the rotr opcode.


15. stack, queue
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the stack and queue opcodes.

The stack opcode

The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default behavior of the program.

16. Brainf*ck
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a Brainf*ck script that prints School, followed by a new line.

#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Add two digits given by the user.

Read the two digits from stdin, add them, and print the result
The total of the two digits with be one digit-long (<10

18. Multiplication
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
